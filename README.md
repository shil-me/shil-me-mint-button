##How to use the button?

1. To use the button, you must first get the ABI and contract address for your collection contract.

You can do this easily by going to Remix, and hitting `Copy ABI` in the Compile tab. If your contract has been code reviewed on EtherScan, you can also use their endpoint to get your ABI as well.

2. After you get your ABI and contract address, you need to configure your button as:

```
import {MintButton} from 'shil-me-mint-button';

<MintButton 
	mintText="Mint an ape"
	mintMethodName="mint" 
	maxMintAmount={4}
	mintMethodInput={[2, "<MINT_COUNT>"]}
	singleMintPriceInWei="10000000000000000"
	buttonStyle={{
		background: 'linear-gradient(to right, #eecda3, #ef629f);'
    }}
	ADDRESS={ADDRESS}
	ABI={ABI} />
```
